- React
- Redux
  
### Backend

- Nest JS
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Kong API
  
## Techniques

- Front-end State Management (React, Redux)
- RESTful API (NestJS, Spring Boot)
- Authentication (JWT)
- Microservices
- Message Broker (RabbitMQ)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Database (JPA, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Session and cached (Redis)
- API Gateway (Kong API)
- Monitoring v√† Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)).
- Unit Testing (Jest, JUnit)
